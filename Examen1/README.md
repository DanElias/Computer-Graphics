# Exam 1 - Sierpinsky Pyramid

## Technologies:
    - Javascript
    - HTML
    - glMatrix library
    - WebGL

## Features:
    - Created a perfect regular Tetrahedron
    - It can be subdivided up to 8 times
    - Each face is subdivided as in Sierpinsky 

## Notes:
    - Rotation might look different as my algorithm starts with the left corner of a face
    and calculates the rest vertices with it but it was left as it was in the source
    code provided
