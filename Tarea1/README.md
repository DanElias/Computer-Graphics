# Homework 1

## Technologies:
    - Javascript
    - HTML
    - glMatrix library
    - WebGL

## Features:
    - Draw pyramid rotating
    - Draw Octahedron moving up-down and rotating
    - Draw Dodecahedron rotating on two axis

## Extras:
    - Simple polygon triangulation for regular polygons for the octahedron and pyramid
    - You are able to draw any type of pyramid, even a cone
    - The same for the octahedron as it is just a pyramid without a base and mirrored downwards
    - Did some automatization for calculating verts, colors and indices for each object just checking repeated patterns
